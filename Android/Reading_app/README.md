When you first open the application, the initial screen displayed is the login screen. If you wish to register, within the login screen, there is a registration option that will take you to the corresponding screen.

Once logged in or registered, you will be redirected to the "Books" screen. On this screen, you will find a button to add books, and you will also see the "All" and "My Books" sections. Within the "My Books" section, you can select a book to add a comment about it. In the top left corner, there is a button that allows you to switch between different screens, such as "Books," "Community and Friends," and "Profile."

Within the "Community and Friends" screen, there are two sections: "Friends," where you can see your friends' comments, and "Community," where you can view comments from everyone.

In the "Profile" screen, you will find four different sections: Charts, Friends, My Comments, and Challenges. Additionally, there is a button to add a profile picture.

Below is a more detailed description of the content of each of the different screens.
