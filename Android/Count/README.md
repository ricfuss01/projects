# Count

In the 'Cuenta' section, you'll find a ticket where, in the top right corner, you can enter the total amount. Using the 'Add' button, you can add individuals, specifying the amount they should contribute and the amount they've actually paid. Each person is added as a card, displaying how much they need to be reimbursed or how much they still owe.

At the bottom left, you can see how much you need to reimburse or how much you owe to the waiter or cashier. At the bottom right, you can check if the sum of everyone's contributions matches the total.

On the other hand, the 'Tricount' section is used to input how much each person has paid. The app calculates the total, divides it by the number of people, and shows how much each person owes or is owed.
